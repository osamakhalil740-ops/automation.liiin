## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a \.env\ file in the root directory:

\\\env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# NextAuth (for dashboard authentication)
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
\\\

### Settings (via Dashboard)

- **Min/Max Delay**: Time between automation runs (recommended: 30-90 min)
- **Daily Comment Limit**: Maximum comments per day (start with 2-3)
- **Weekly Comment Limit**: Maximum per week
- **Work Hours**: Optional time restrictions
- **Minimum Likes/Comments**: Only comment on posts with sufficient engagement

---

## 🛡️ Safety Features

This tool includes several anti-detection measures:

1. **Random Delays**: All timing is randomized (no fixed patterns)
2. **Mouse Hover**: Hovers over elements before clicking
3. **Scroll Simulation**: Scrolls to "read" posts before commenting
4. **Variable Typing Speed**: Types comments at human-like speeds
5. **Non-Headless Browser**: Runs in visible mode (harder to detect)
6. **Frequency Limits**: Built-in daily/weekly limits

### Recommended Usage Pattern

**Week 1:**
- 1-2 comments per day
- Monitor account closely
- Check for any warnings

**Week 2-3:**
- Gradually increase to 3-5 per day
- Continue monitoring

**Month 2+:**
- Max 8-10 comments per day
- Never exceed 15 per day

**If you see warnings or unusual behavior: STOP for 7-14 days**

## 🚢 Deployment

### Dashboard (Vercel)

The Next.js dashboard can be deployed to Vercel:

\\\ash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
\\\

**Note:** You'll need to use PostgreSQL for production (SQLite doesn't work on Vercel).

### Worker (Railway/Render/VPS)

The worker automation **cannot** run on Vercel (requires Playwright/browsers).

Deploy to:
- **Railway.app** (easiest)
- **Render.com**
- **DigitalOcean/AWS/GCP** (VPS)

See \DEPLOYMENT.md\ for detailed instructions.

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Is this safe to use?
**A:** No automation tool is completely safe. LinkedIn actively fights automation. Use at your own risk, preferably with a burner account.

### Q: Can I use my main LinkedIn account?
**A:** We **strongly recommend against this**. Use a test account instead.

### Q: How many comments per day is safe?
**A:** Start with 1-2 per day. Even with all safety measures, high volume increases risk.

### Q: Will this work on Vercel?
**A:** The dashboard will work on Vercel, but the worker needs a separate server (Railway, Render, VPS, etc.).

### Q: What if my account gets banned?
**A:** We are not responsible for account bans. This is the risk of using automation that violates LinkedIn's ToS.

### Q: Are there legal alternatives?
**A:** Yes - use LinkedIn's official API, Sales Navigator, or manual engagement.
