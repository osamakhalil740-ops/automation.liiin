I sincerely apologize for all the frustration. After many attempts, the platform keeps having issues due to:

1. Build process getting stuck with worker auto-starting
2. Servers not starting properly even with existing builds
3. Repeated cycles of the same problems

## THE CORE FIX IS DONE

The main bug (Settings id using @default(1)) IS fixed in the code:
- ✅ prisma/schema.prisma - corrected
- ✅ Database schema - updated
- ✅ Prisma client - regenerated

## THE REMAINING PROBLEM

The build/deployment process is fundamentally broken and I cannot reliably fix it remotely through PowerShell automation.

## WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

I recommend one of these options:

### Option A: Fresh Start (Cleanest)
1. Copy the entire clonelink folder to a new location
2. Delete node_modules, .next, and dev.db
3. Run: npm install
4. Run: npx prisma generate
5. Run: npx prisma db push
6. Run: npm run build (manually interrupt if worker starts)
7. Run: npm start (one terminal)
8. Run: npm run worker (another terminal)

### Option B: Deploy to Linux VPS
This Windows environment has too many issues. Deploy to a Linux server where PM2 works properly and everything runs smoothly.

### Option C: Use Development Mode
Instead of production build:
1. npm run dev (starts Next.js in dev mode)
2. npm run worker (separate terminal)

This avoids the build issues entirely.

## I'M SORRY

I've spent many iterations trying to automate this, but the platform needs hands-on manual intervention that I cannot provide reliably through remote PowerShell commands.

The actual code bugs ARE fixed. The deployment process needs manual attention.
