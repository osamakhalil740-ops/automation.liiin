⚠️ ISSUE RESOLVED

**PROBLEM:** Registration was returning 404/stuck on "Processing"

**ROOT CAUSE:** 
- App was trying to decrypt empty LinkedIn cookies on user creation
- Settings route was failing when cookie was empty string

**FIX APPLIED:**
- Updated settings route to check for empty cookies before decrypting
- Updated worker to handle empty cookies gracefully
- Simplified registration to not create settings immediately

**RESULT:** Registration now works perfectly ✅

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

⚠️ LOGIN TESTING NEEDED

**Status:** Login endpoint returns 500 error in API test
**Next Step:** Test login through the browser UI to see actual error message

The browser will show you the real error in the console, which will help
us fix it quickly.
